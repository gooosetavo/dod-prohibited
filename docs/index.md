# DoD Prohibited Dietary Supplement Ingredients

This site provides a searchable, browsable, and regularly updated list of substances prohibited by the Department of Defense (DoD) for use in dietary supplements.

## Why this site?

The official [DoD prohibited ingredients page](https://www.opss.org/dod-prohibited-dietary-supplement-ingredients) is difficult to navigate, lacks search/filter features, and is not easily accessible for quick reference or research. This site was created to make this important information more accessible to service members, researchers, and the public.

## How is this data retrieved?

- The data is automatically scraped from the official DoD page using an open-source script.
- The site is rebuilt and updated daily, and on every change to the codebase.
- Each substance has its own page with detailed information, references, and links to official sources.

## How to use this site

- Use the search bar or navigation to find a substance.
- Click on a substance to view detailed information, including:
	- Name and other known names
	- Classifications and legal status
	- Reasons for prohibition (with links)
	- Warnings and references
	- Source and more info links
	- When the entry was added/updated
- Use the dark/light mode toggle in the top right for your preferred viewing mode.
